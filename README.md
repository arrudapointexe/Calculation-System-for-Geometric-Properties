# 🧮 Geometric Properties Calculation System

This project was developed for the "Computer Programming 1" course. Its goal is to implement a C program capable of calculating geometric properties such as **area and perimeter** of various shapes: **circle, rectangle, and triangle**.

## 📚 Objective

To consolidate core programming concepts in C, from fundamentals to advanced topics like **pointers**, **structs**, **dynamic memory allocation**, **functions**, and **recursion**.

## 🚀 Features

- Area and perimeter calculation for:
  - Circle
  - Rectangle
  - Triangle
- Interactive menu interface for input/output
- Runs continuously until the user chooses to exit
- Arrays and matrices used to store shape data
- String manipulation for labeling shapes
- `struct Figura` used to organize figure information
- Dynamic vector of multiple shapes
- Input validation (prevents negative values)
- Final report displaying all processed shapes and results
- Use of pointers and dynamic memory management
- Recursive factorial function (used for figure with n sides)

## 🛠️ How to Compile

You can compile the project using `gcc`:

```bash
gcc main.c -o geometric_system
./geometric_system
